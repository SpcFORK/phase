## February 2024 - v3 release

Here's a quick overview of what's new:

* The site has been <u>completely</u> recoded.
* We have actual documentation now!
* There's a shiny new dashboard.
* A few bugs were squashed.
* Bot branding stuff was updated.
* Terms and Privacy docs got some love.
* Website and bot hosters were changed.
* The bot and site codebases were merged.

Now that v3 is released, I'm gonna be stepping back a little bit to focus more on other projects, but I'll no doubt be back in a few months to overwork myself some more. Hope you enjoy the new update! ü§ç
