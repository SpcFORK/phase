          servers as possible, with a large variety of different modules and

          Whether you're seeking to enhance a small server shared with friends
          or overseeing a bustling community, Phase is your solution for

          Discord experience.

          Why should I use Phase?
        </h2>
        <p>
          You might be thinking "My server is already set up with a load of
          other bots, why go through the hassle of switching?". And... yes, but
          while popular bots like MEE6 or Dyno have their strengths, they lack
          transparency. In contrast, Phase is fully open source, so you can see
          all the wonderful spaghetti code that goes into making it - you can
          even contribute if you want to!
        </p>
        <p>
          But the best part is, we listen to our users. If you need a specific
          command or module for your server, just ask and we'll make it happen.
          You get a fancy bot experience with all the things your server needs
          without the stress, tears, and existential questioning that comes with
          actually building one. Plus, Phase is also completely free to use.
          While donations are appreciated to support the developer both
          financially and emotionally, they're entirely optional.
